Urgent and Emergency Care (UEC) services are in place to support patients with serious or life-threatening emergencies as well as those with urgent care needs.

UEC services include 999 and 111 telephony and online services, ambulance, Emergency Departments (EDs), Urgent Treatment Centres (UTCs) as well as services supporting those with specific health emergencies (such as for mental health and dental).

This site provides technical standards and guidance for those who commission, provide and support UEC services, including suppliers, and should be read in conjunction with other UEC specifications including the NHSE Integrated Urgent Care Specification and the NHSE Commissioning Standards for Integrated Urgent Care.

These Interoperability & Technical Standards support the [NHS England Integrated Urgent Care Service Specification](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Integrated-Urgent-Care-Service-Specification.pdf)
