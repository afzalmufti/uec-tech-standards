There is a demand for direct appointment booking capabilities across multiple Urgent and Emergency Care (UEC) services in England. This need stems from system interoperability and strategic requirements for the future of the UEC system in England. Therefore there is a need for a national standard that sets out what appointment booking solutions should and should not be able to do.

The UEC appointment booking standard is an open standard supporting booking across many care settings.
It utilises the CareConnect FHIR messaging standard and is being published in the form of a website.
