The Clinical Decision Support (CDS) RESTful FHIR STU3 ‘Read Only’ experimental API implementation guide supports the initiatives set out by the [UEC Digital Integration Programme](https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/our-work/transforming-health-and-care-through-technology/urgent-and-emergency-care-domain-b/urgent-and-emergency-care-digital-integration).

The guide covers triage of patients by non-clinical staff and triage of patients by clinicians. The guide is intended for use by developers who are making systems compliant with the guide.

The Implementation Guide is based on initial discovery work, which informs the 1.0.0-alpha version of the Guide. The scope is expected to increase with more discovery work and as use cases are developed. Future versions of this Guide will include those updates as they are developed. Any resources not specifically mentioned in the Guide will follow the [HL7 FHIR STU3 guidance](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/index.html).
