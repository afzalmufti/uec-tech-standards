#### Q: What is ITK?

A: You can read what ITK is and isn't [here](what_is_itk.html)

#### Q: Do I have to support the **Nullify** interaction in my system?

A: No - the Nullify interaction was excluded from the Urgent Care implementation of ITK Messaging as it was not deemed to be safe enough to cancel a pending interaction for a patient without human intervention.
