The SCR<sup>1</sup> holds important information from the GP patient record, including:

* Name, address, date of birth and NHS number of the patient)

* Current medication

* Allergies and details of any previous adverse reactions to medicines

It may also include additional information, such as details of long-term conditions, significant medical history, or specific communications needs.


The Integrated Urgent Care Service Specification<sup>2</sup> has clear requirements relating to SCR access and integration:

* ensure that health care professionals have effective access to the SCR for all patients, subject to appropriate access controls.

* access the SCR must be embedded within the chosen clinical workflow system as an integrated part of the workflow.

To meet these requirements, information from the SCR can be presented as rendered document, through an existing stand-alone web portal (SCRa), or via an integrated view within an existing clinical system<sup>4</sup>.

The data for the SCR can also be accessed directly via Spine using the EIS defined interfaces or Simplified Spine Mini Services. For more information on accessing the SCR directly, contact the SCR team at NHS Digital: [enquiries@digital.nhs.uk](mailto:enquiries@digital.nhs.uk)
